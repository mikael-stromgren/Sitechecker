Author: Mikael Str√∂mgren

Tested with Wordpress 4.9.5 and PHP 7.1.4 (x64)

Sitechecker lets you check the status of websites. It is a single-file Wordpress plugin and is installed using the instructions for manual plugin installation 
found at the end of this READ.ME file. Also found at https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation

Installation of the plugin creates two admin screens:

Sitechecker

The screen is updated automatically every 60 seconds. This check frequency can be changed to suit the user's needs.

- Where you can add and delete websites to/from the list, as well as change how frequently the check should be done. 


TODO
